                <p class="description">When we start a new project at the Innovation Studio the effort is kicked off by initial user research and is followed by our complete User-Centered UX process.  This initial research shapes our product direction so that our offering will enable users to effectively and intuitively accomplish what they need. This iterative process involves not only potential users, but also all the stakeholders including business partners, the technology team and leadership. </p>

As a result, we approach each opportunity we have to improve through well-built software as a new business. This drives us to work closely with stakeholders, users and leadership throughout the entire process.</p>

                <p class="description">The Innovation Studio embraces what has been traditionally seen as failure in IT.  Our process encourages all members of the team to be constantly experimenting, testing and evaluating with our products, methodology and more.  A fundamental principle of this team is that the process of creating the best possible product will and should include failures along the way.  </p>

Testing, in all its forms, Unit, Functional, Design Assessments, etc, has become expected behavior for everyone apart of the Innovation Studio. As a result we can proudly state that our phones never ring because our code has broken down. </p>
